# GLIB
A Graphics/Menu/Grid Library for MC OpenComputers

Much of the underlying gui/graphics code, especially primatives have been sourced from Sampa's NIDAS application, available here: https://github.com/S4mpsa/NIDAS. Many thanks for your permission to use this codebase.

Library Foundations:

1. Graphis Primatives, 1 layer up from OpenComputers core

2. Windows/Screen framework for reusable/interactable display

3. Core Menu (Tab) frame akin to browser tabs for applications to create reference and share windows/screens

4. Screen content rendering capabilities

4.1 Grid layout
